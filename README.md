"Spectral Lab" is a brand new compositional tool with a spectrogram,  which enhances musiciansâ€™ creativity.  
It looks like a piano roll or a sequencer but is distinguished by the following points.  
- Extract spectral features from audio files and treat them as musical notes.
- Freely editing notes in such a way that a painter draws on a canvas.
- Ideal for creating unheard harmonies, fluid textures, and expressions of nuances.
- Compatible with any MIDI instruments of various possibilities.
